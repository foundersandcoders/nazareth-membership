## What is a member?
There are two types of memberships. The first is [Voting Membership](#voting-membership) and the second is [Associate Membership](#associate-membership). 


## Voting membership

#### Who can apply?
- Voting membership will be available to programme graduates, who have **attended two business meetings**, unless they have documented violations of the [code of conduct](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
- At their discretion, the directors may also extend invitations to individuals who have not graduated from the programme, such as @iteles, @nelsonic, @sofer, and @rebeccaradding


#### Rights and responsibilities:
- Members have the right (but not obligation) to make proposals, to vote on proposals at monthly meetings, and to join committees with delegated decision making power.
- Members will also have the option to make donations to Founders and Coders whether one off, or monthly. This is not an obligation, but simply a suggestion. 


#### How to apply for voting membership
Please make a PR to this repo adding your name to the membership [register](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-membership/blob/master/register.md). Your PR should include:
- Your full name
- Which cohort you graduated from
- Dates of two business meetings you have attended


## Associate membership

Associate membership will be automatically conferred onto programme participants.

Associate membership will also be available to people from the wider community (who are not programme graduates)

As an associate member, you are welcome to attend the business meetings and participate in discussions. However without voting membership, you cannot vote on proposals.
